1. General info
---------------

   SymTorrent is a BitTorrent client for Symbian based smartphones built on the S60 platform.
   You can use SymTorrent to download torrents right to your mobile phone. Torrents can be started
   from the browser by clicking on torrent links. If the torrent contains multiple files, you
   can select which files you want to download. 


2. Version history
------------------

    1.32 -  Bufixes:

            + A memory leak in the tracker has been fixed
            + Some misspellings has been corrected

            Major source code modifications:

            + The networking and logging has been moved to separate libraries (KiNetwork is responsible for handling network connections, sockets, etc.
              KiLogger is a general logging library which enables logging into multiple files with timestamps).

    1.30 -  + End game algorithm implemented, downloading shouldn't slow down at the end. When a torrent enters ebd game, an "EG" label will appear
              next to the download percentage in the torrent's status view.
            + Network address of the devices is displayed correctly in the Status panel.
            + In the torrent status view, the total number of peers is displayed (in brackets) along with the number of connected peers for each torrent.
            + Backup & restore functionality for S60 3rd edition is now working for SymTorrent.
            + The settings menu has been divided into a couple of sub-parts (separate page for general, proxy, and tracker settings).
            + Piece hashes are checked when the application loads (can be enabled / disabled in the settings). 
              This prevents deleted files appearing as downloaded.
              Piece hashes are checked when a new torrent is opened. If matching files are found in the target directory then those parts of torrent appears as downloaded.
              Hash checking can always be skipped by pressing the Cancel softkey.
            + Settings and download status are automatically saved in every 60 seconds (in previous versions the interval was 2 minutes).

            Bugfixes:

            + "SymTorrent disconnects good peers after handshake" MAJOR BUG fixed (apparently it caused that SymTorrent disconnected from around the third of the peers
              right after handshake)
            + "Application won't start after changing the incoming port" bug fixed
            + "Application crashes in the Torrent Properties view if the 'Comment' or 'Created by' fields in a torrent are longer than 200 characters" bug fixed
            + "Loading torrents with empty files (0 bytes) crashes" bug fixed
            + "Wrong IP address is sent to the tracker if the device is behind a router (NAT)" bug fixed (IP address is now sent only if proxy connection is used)
            + "SymTorrent cannot open sound files in the Files View" bug fixed (the file opening mechanism is completely replaced, files are now opened embedded in SymTorrent)

            Major source code modifications:

            + Tracker is moved to a separate DLL. From now on, SymTorrent will be released in two different packages: one with and one without the built-in tracker (it saves memory if you
              use the version which doesn't have the tracker)

    1.26 -  Major bugfix ("downloads slow down at the end" problem fixed), status of tracker is displayed in the tracker view. On the protocol
            level, piece requests are sent in bursts (it may also speed up transfer a bit).

    1.21 -  Added multi-tracker support (SymTorrent now parses "announce-list" entries from the torren files)
            Added proxy support (you can run a proxy on a separate desktop computer to provide public IP address for your mobile device)
            Added tracker (a basic tracker service is available inside SymTorrent)
            Some fixes in the UI (hopefully, the flickering in the download state view is gone)
            Pieces are downloaded in random order
            For developers: SymTorrent is divided into several separate projects, e.g. the engine is available in a separate DLL.

    1.10 -  Client can accept incomming connections.
            Some bugs have been fixed.
            The state of torrents is saved in every 2 minutes. 
            Both S60 3rd and 2nd edition phones are supported.

    1.0  -  Initial release


3. Installation
---------------

    SymTorrent is a self-signed application, which means it has not been sent to Symbian for testing. Before installation
    you should make sure your phone has the "Software installation" option of the Application manager set to "All" 
    (Tools / App. mgr. / Settings), otherwise the phone may refuse to install the application.


4. Known issues
---------------

   SymTorrent rarely crashes during download (the application exits and needs to be restarted to continue downloading).
   
   Poor performance with large (larger than 2 GByte) torrents.

   Some downloaded files are not accessible while other parts of the associated torrent are still being downloaded.

   There could be some issues with the built-in tracker.
    

5. Developer info
----------------------
   
   SymTorrent consists of several projects, which needs to be built separately to prepare the complete application. Each project
   has a separate directory.
   In order to get a running version of SymTorrent, you only need to build "SymTorrentEngine" and "SymTorrent". The
   projects "TorrentRecog" and "SymTorrentLaunch" are responsible for autostarting SymTorrent when a .torrent file
   is selected on the phone.
   
   The complete list of projects included in the repository:

      SymTorrent             - The UI and the other "high level" components of the application excluding the BitTorrent engine.

      SymTorrentEngine       - A separate DLL which is responsible for all the UI independent client functions, such as connecting 
                               the tracker, communicating with the peers, etc. If you are thinking on creating your own BitTorrent-based
                               application then you will need this project. It also includes the communication/network related code.

      SymTorrentLauncher     - Separate dummy application for launching SymTorrent when a recognizer finds an associated file (.torrent).

      TorrentRecog		     - A recognizer for .torrent files (the sis file must be Symbian-signed otherwise recognizers
                               won't install on the phone!). A prebuilt and express signed sis file is included in the SymTorrent subproject's
							   SIS directory.
	  
	  KiLogger				 - Project for file based debug logging. Logging is disabled by default so you do not need to bother with this.
  
   Furthermore, there is a Screenshots directory holding a couple of screenshots for SymTorrent and the logo.
   
   The projects can be built with S60 3rd MR SDK or newer version. Using a newer SDK actually gives no benefits so I recommend using
   the 3rd MR version to maintain the broadest device compatibility.
   
   Using Carbide C++:
   
   In order to build SymTorrent, first initialize Carbide C++ with a new workspace (preferably the directory where all the SymTorrent
   subprojects are located). After that import each subproject one-by-one using the File/Import/Symbian OS/Symbian OS bld.inf file menu
   command (select bld.inf from the subproject_name\group directory). Make sure that when the wizard gets to the "Project name and location" 
   part, the "Root directory" points to the root of the current subproject (e.g. SymTorrent\SymTorrentEngine for SymTorrentEngine) not to 
   the root of the repository. Otherwise you will get errors at the end of the import process.
   To get a SIS installer at the end of the build proces, you need to configure the SIS builder for the "SymTorrent" project. Select the
   SymTorrent project the go to Project/Properties/Carbide C++/Build Configurations/SIS Builder. Add a new SIS and select SymTorrent.pkg
   as the package file. SymTorrent can be built as a self-signed app.
   When done, first build KiLogger, then SymTorrentEngine and finally SymTorrent. If everything is done correctly, you should have a signed
   SIS file in the directory, you gave at the SIS Builder settings.
